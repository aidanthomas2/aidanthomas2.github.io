With a keen interest in storytelling and media, I strive to create engaging content that resonates with audiences. Through various projects and internships (Omaha Stormchasers/Lincoln Saltdogs), I have developed strong skills in writing, editing, graphic design, photography, and digital communication. I am excited and hopeful to contribute to the ever-evolving field of sports media and my goal/wish is that I make a positive impact through my work."
