    "text": "Anthony Edwards has emerged as one of the NBA’s most electrifying young stars, captivating audiences with his explosive athleticism and fearless shot making. But beneath the highlight reel dunks and clutch performances lies a question that deserves closer examination: Is his shooting actually as elite as the narrative suggests?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\ntrueshooting &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/trueshooting.csv\")\n  \nplayers &lt;- trueshooting |&gt;\n    filter(`TSPCT▼` &gt; .57) |&gt;\n    filter(G &gt; 70) |&gt;\n    filter(Pos == \"SG\")\n\nant &lt;- players |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Anthony Edwards\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=players, aes(x=reorder(Player, `TSPCT▼`), weight=`TSPCT▼`)) +\n  geom_bar(data=ant, aes(x=reorder(Player, `TSPCT▼`), weight=`TSPCT▼`), fill=\"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Players\", \n    y=\"True Shooting Percentage\", \n    title=\"Anthony Edwards was effective scoring the ball, but others were better\", \n    subtitle=\"Anthony Edwards ranked 13th last season in terms of true shooting percentage among shooting guards that played at least 70 regular season games.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Aidan Thomas\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we compare Edwards’ true shooting percentage (a basketball statistic that measures scoring efficiency by accounting for two-point field goals, three-point field goals, and free throws), to other shooting guards in similar roles, a surprising pattern emerges. Despite carrying comparable offensive loads, Edwards ranked surprisingly low last season (13th out of the top 20 shooting guards in terms of true shooting percentage).\nWhat makes this gap particularly noteworthy is that Edwards often takes similarly difficult shots compared to his counterparts on this list. He creates off the dribble, attacks the basket, and launches deep threes with defenders draped on him. The problem isn’t shot difficulty, it’s conversion rate. He’s certainly a good scorer, but the numbers suggest he’s not yet operating at the truly elite efficiency level we might assume from watching his game.\nPerhaps the most telling story comes from tracking Edwards’ development over his career. Has he been steadily improving his efficiency, or has his reputation as a “superstar” been built primarily on increased volume rather than refined accuracy?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\nantfieldgoal &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/antfieldgoal.csv\")\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\nzach &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/zach.csv\")\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\nshai &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/shai.csv\")\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\njalen &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/jalen.csv\")\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\ndonovan &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/donovan.csv\")\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\naverage &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/average.csv\")\n\nggplot() + geom_line(data=antfieldgoal, aes(x=Season, y=eFGPCT), color=\"green\") +\n  geom_line(data=zach, aes(x=Season, y=eFGPCT), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_line(data=shai, aes(x=Season, y=eFGPCT), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_line(data=jalen, aes(x=Season, y=eFGPCT), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_line(data=donovan, aes(x=Season, y=eFGPCT), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=average, aes(x=Season, y=eFGPCT)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(.4, .65)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023, y=.51, label=\"Anthony Edwards\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2022, y=.585, label=\"Donovan Mitchell\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.5, y=.60, label=\"Zach Lavine\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2021, y=.48, label=\"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.75, y=.56, label=\"Jalen Brunson\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2020.3, y=.545, label=\"AVERAGE\"), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Effective Field Goal Percentage\", \n    title=\"Anthony Edwards is not as efficient as other elite shooting guards\", \n    subtitle=\"Anthony Edwards has struggled to shoot the ball efficiently in his career, staying below the league average up until last season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Aidan Thomas\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe league average for effective field goal percentage (a basketball statistic that adjusts for the value of 3-point shots to give a more accurate measure of shooting efficiency than traditional field goal percentage) over the last five seasons has consistently been around 53-54%. Edwards has been routinely below this mark for the majority of his career up until last season.\nNotable names like Jalen Brunson, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Zach Lavine, and Donovan Mitchell have easily been above league average for the majority of their careers, while Edwards has been the opposite.\nThe narrative of Edwards as a rapidly developing shooter appears premature. He’s still improving, but he’s doing so incrementally, not exponentially. The perception of elite shooting seems to be based more on his confidence, his volume, and his ability to hit difficult shots in big moments than on consistent, efficient scoring night after night.\nThe final piece of the puzzle comes from examining where Edwards takes his shots and how efficiently he converts from each zone compared to league averages.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\nzones &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/zones.csv\")\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\nantzones &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/aidanthomas2.github.io/posts/is-anthony-edwards-a-good-shooter/antzones.csv\")\n\nantzonez &lt;- antzones |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalTwoP = sum(TwoP),\n    TotalZerotoThree = sum(ZerotoThree),\n    TotalThreetoTen = sum(ThreetoTen),\n    TotalTentoSixteen = sum(TentoSixteen),\n    TotalSixteentoThreeP = sum(SixteentoThreeP),\n    TotalThreeP = sum(ThreeP)\n  )\n\nantzonezlong &lt;- antzonez |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"ZonePCT\")\n\nzonez &lt;- zones |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalTwoP = sum(TwoP),\n    TotalZerotoThree = sum(ZerotoThree),\n    TotalThreetoTen = sum(ThreetoTen),\n    TotalTentoSixteen = sum(TentoSixteen),\n    TotalSixteentoThreeP = sum(SixteentoThreeP),\n    TotalThreeP = sum(ThreeP)\n  )\n\nzonezlong &lt;- zonez |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"ZonePCT\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=zonezlong, aes(x=reorder(Team, ZonePCT), weight=ZonePCT, fill=Type)) + \n  geom_bar(data=antzonezlong, aes(x=Team, weight=ZonePCT, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Anthony Edwards/Teams\", \n    y=\"Zone Percentage\", \n    title=\"Anthony Edwards is below average in terms of percentage from certain zones on the court\", \n    subtitle=\"He is around average when getting to the rim, but struggles once he gets 16+ feet away.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Aidan Thomas\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to getting to the rim and shooting close range, Edwards is right around average compared to the percentage of each teams players combined from last season. Quite impressive.\nWhere it really starts to show is when Edwards gets to 16+ feet away from the basket. His averages compared to the league at large are nowhere near each other.\nThe result is a paradox: Edwards looks like a complete offensive weapon because he attempts shots from everywhere, but the numbers show he’d be more effective concentrating his firepower closer to the rim.\nIn conclusion, Anthony Edwards is undeniably a star. His confidence, his clutch gene, and his ability to create something from nothing make him one of the league’s most exciting players. But when we separate perception from reality, the data suggests his shooting isn’t yet at the elite level the narrative implies.\nNone of this diminishes Edwards’ impact or potential. At just 24 years old, he has plenty of time to refine his game. The question is whether he’ll develop the efficiency and shot selection discipline to match his already elite volume and reputation."

When we examine Johnson’s per-36-minute statistics across his career, we see more than just volume increases, we see efficiency gains that suggest real skill development. Per 36 Minutes in the NBA refers to a statistic that projects a player’s counting stats (like points, rebounds, and assists) over the course of a 36-minute game. All three of these statistics for Johnson per 36 minutes have all trended upward, especially him scoring the ball.\nWhen comparing him to other top prospects from his draft class (Evan Mobley, Scottie Barnes, Josh Giddey, Jonathan Kuminga), Johnson is outperforming all of them this season. While they may have been scoring more to start their careers, Johnson has continued to get better and surpass them this season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\njalenjohnsonefficiency &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/jalenjohnsonefficiency.csv\")\n\njalenefficiency &lt;- jalenjohnsonefficiency |&gt;\n  group_by(Season, Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalTSPCT = sum(TSPCT),\n    TotaleFGPCT = sum(eFGPCT)\n )\n\ntotaljaelnjohnsonefficiency &lt;- jalenefficiency |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Efficiency\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=totaljaelnjohnsonefficiency, aes(x=Season, weight=Efficiency, fill=Type)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2025, y=87.5, label=\"59%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2025, y=25, label=\"63%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2024, y=87.5, label=\"54%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2024, y=25, label=\"57%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023, y=87.5, label=\"56%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023, y=25, label=\"58%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2022, y=87.5, label=\"54%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2022, y=25, label=\"55%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2021, y=87.5, label=\"57%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2021, y=25, label=\"59%\"), color=\"black\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Effectvie Field Goal Percentage and True Shooting Percentage\", \n    title=\"Jalen Johnson has been getting more efficient\", \n    subtitle=\"Jalen Johnson is the most efficient he's been in his career this season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Aidan Thomas\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe efficiency metrics paint an even more interesting picture. Johnson’s true shooting percentage (a basketball statistic that measures scoring efficiency by accounting for two-point field goals, three-point field goals, and free throws) has improved alongside his expanded role, a rare feat that separates stars from volume scorers. Many players see their efficiency crater when given more touches; Johnson has maintained or improved his shooting efficiency while dramatically increasing his offensive involvement. His effective field goal percentage (a basketball statistic that adjusts for the value of 3-point shots to give a more accurate measure of shooting efficiency than traditional field goal percentage) tells a similar story, indicating that he’s not just taking more shots, he’s taking better ones.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(readr)\nnbausagerate &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/SPMC 350/nbausagerate.csv\")\n\nnewnbausagerate &lt;- nbausagerate |&gt;\n  filter(\n    G &gt; 20\n  )\n\nfilterednbausagerate &lt;- newnbausagerate |&gt;\n  filter(\n    PER &gt; 23.3 &\n      USGPCT &gt; 26.0\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=newnbausagerate, aes(x=USGPCT, y=PER), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=filterednbausagerate, aes(x=USGPCT, y=PER), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=newnbausagerate, aes(x=USGPCT, y=PER), method=\"lm\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 40.0)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=filterednbausagerate, aes(x=USGPCT, y=PER, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Usage Percentage\", \n    y=\"Player Efficiency Rating\", \n    title=\"Jalen Johnson is in some elite company\", \n    subtitle=\"Jalen Johnson has been as efficient as some of the league's best this season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Aidan Thomas\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps most telling is the relationship between his usage rate (an advanced stat estimating the percentage of a team’s plays a player “uses” while on the court, showing their offensive responsibility and how much they dominate the ball) and player efficiency rating (an advanced statistic that summarizes a player’s per-minute production into a single number, adjusting for pace and league averages). When we plot these variables against each other, Johnson doesn’t follow the typical pattern of declining efficiency with increased usage. Instead, he’s managed to scale his production without sacrificing his effectiveness, a hallmark of players who possess genuine star-level talent.\nThis season, Johnson is in some elite company, being as efficient as some of the NBA’s biggest stars that have played at least 20 games like Nikola Jokic, Shai-Gilgeous Alexander, James Harden, and Donovan Mithcell. Not too shabby.\nHowever, context matters enormously in the NBA, and Johnson’s situation in Atlanta provides plenty of it. The Hawks have dealt with injuries, roster turnover, and a general lack of star power in recent seasons. Johnson has gone from a raw prospect fighting for minutes to a featured player in an offense that needs someone, anyone, to step up and carry the load.\nIn conclusion, the data suggests Johnson is more than just an opportunity merchant, but he’s not quite an established elite player yet either. He occupies that fascinating middle ground: a player with legitimate star tools who has seized his opportunity and shown the ability to produce efficiently in an expanded role.\nThe rest of this season will be telling. If Johnson can maintain his efficiency while drawing more defensive attention, potentially playing alongside a healthy Hawks roster with other scoring options, he’ll prove the doubters wrong. If his numbers regress when the easy opportunities dry up, the skeptics will have their answer.\nFor now, Jalen Johnson sits in that exciting space where the answer to “How good is he really?” is “Let’s watch and find out.” And in a league always searching for the next star, that’s exactly where you want to be."
